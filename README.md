Quadrae
=======

A game with falling 4-tiled shapes. My very quick One Game A Month entry for February 2013.
Goal is to fill horizontal bars with the oddly shaped pieces. It's a clone of a game whose owner company
is somewhat litigious, so I will not put its name here, but you know what it is.

Feats
- Very short dev time
- Falling blocks that you can move and rotate
- Happy colors

Right now, Mac OS X build only, will add Code::Blocks stuff for Win & Lin soon.
